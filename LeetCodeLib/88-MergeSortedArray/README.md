# 88. Merge Sorted Array
## Goal
Given:
* `std::vector<int> &nums1`
* `int m`: logical size of `nums1`
* `std::vector<int> &nums2`
* `int n`: logical size of `nums2`

The goal is to modify `nums1` in place such that all elements of `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in
non-decreasing order. Note that `nums1` is already sized to store all the necessary values and
contains zeros in the indexes beyond the first `m` elements.
