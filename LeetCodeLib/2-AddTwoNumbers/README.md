# 2. Add Two Numbers
## Goal
Given:
* `ListNode` is defined as a linked list node that contains values between 0 and 9 representing
a non-negative integer in reverse order
* `ListNode *list1, *list2`

The goal is to calculate the sum of the two "integers" as represented in another `ListNode`.

## Solutions
### Iterative
Walk through both lists adding the "digits" and propagating a carry as necessary. Nothing
too fancy.

### Recursive
Nothing special again, though less feasible with large sized inputs due to stack limits
